Minefield Flags
===============

The idea of this project it to enable Minefield's players draw their own custom flags. For the timebeing it works pretty simple - you draw a flag, submit it, then I add it to the game if it corresponds to the Minefield's general style and simply looks good. This process can take some time since it is not automated yet.

Server architecture is based on [Blank](https://github.com/borbit/blank).
